Summary
Welcome to the Cloud Native Fundamentals course!

Before building an application, it is common to go through a design phase to identify the main requirements and structure of an application. In correlation with the available resources, a team will choose the most suitable project architecture.

In the industry, usually, the two main approaches that are usually referenced are monoliths and microservices. In this lesson, we will explore each architectural model and the implied trade-offs. As well, we will cover good development practices to be considered if an application is targeted for containerization. These practices are valid for both monolith and microservice architectures.
