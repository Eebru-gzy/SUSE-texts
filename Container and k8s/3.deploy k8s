Deploy Your First Kubernetes Cluster
Cluster Creation

Summary
Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster is known as the bootstrapping process. When creating a cluster, it is essential to ensure that each node had the necessary components installed. It is possible to manually provision a cluster, however, this implied the distribution and execution of each component independently (e.g. kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kubelet, etc.). This is a highly tedious task that has a higher risk of misconfiguration.

As a result, multiple tools emerged to handle the bootstrapping of a cluster automatically. For example:

Production-grade clusters
kubeadm
Kubespray
Kops
K3s
Developmnet-grade clusters
kind
minikube
k3d
A good introduction to k3d, written by k3d's creator Thorsten Klein, can be found here

Create Vagrant Box And Install Kubernetes with k3s
This demo is a step-by-step guide on how to create a vagrant box and install a Kubernetes cluster using k3s. To follow this demo, reference the Vagrantfile from the course repository.

A nice introduction to Vagrant can be found in this article

Before following the demo:

Make sure to have VirtualBox 6.1.16 or higher installed.
You also need to install vagrant on your machine.

Throughout the demo, the following kubectl commands are used:

# Inspect available vagrant boxes 
vagrant status 

# create a vagrant box using the Vagrantfile in the current directory
vagrant up

# SSH into the vagrant box
# Note: this command uses the .vagrant folder to identify the details of the vagrant box
vagrant ssh
